title: "Fore! (Double Double Whammy)"
---


Dedicated indie fans couldn’t miss productions from neonatal label (2011), Double Double Whammy (DDW), this past year. Advocates of cassette, wax, and CDs, DDW dropped some big rocks into the indie pool in 2014. Indie fans have seen the faces of Mitski, Frankie Cosmos, and Radiator Hospital especially due to Pitchfork’s recognition, but hopefully dug in deeper to find other DDW artists like Porches., Crying, SPOOK HOUSES, LVL UP, and QUARTERBACKS. DDW founders include Mike Caridi (LVL UP) and Dave Benson. Fans can reasonably expect 2015 releases from bands named in all caps. Spare Grandma officially deems DDW as a favorite young indie label thanks to their hard work and choice releases in 2014.
