"Hellfyre run this here, did you know that," raps LA MC Nocando on his 2014 album Jimmy The Burnout. Former Scribble Jam Champion/LA Weekly writer Nocando started Hellfyre Club as an extension of Low End Theory and the LA beat music scene back in 2012. 2014 was the year Hellfyre Club had its coming out party with major releases from its flagship artists Nocando, Open Mike Eagle, Busdriver, and Milo. Hellfyre ran the indie rap game in 2014, and listeners can expect more to come for 2015.  Other artists signed to the label include Anderson .Paak, Rheteric Ramirez, KAIL, Taurus Scott, VerBs, and The Kleenerz. Hellfyre Club proved itself as a home for forward thinking Hip Hop carrying the torch of Project Blowed into the new decade. Spare Grandma officially endorses Hellfyre Club and gave Open Mike Eagle's Dark Comedy the no. 3 spot on our end of the year albums list.
